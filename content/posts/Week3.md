# This week
This week was mostly aimed towards meeting people from RedHenLab as well as our peers.

## Meeting #1
Professor Mark organized a meeting consisting of mentors and contributors. The contributors were limited to the people Mark is mentoring. It was a normal discussion where people talked about the things they are doing where they are from etc. 

## Meeting #2
During the first meeting, Mark had informed me that Parth's project and mine arise from a similar arena i.e of Christian Art so he suggested me to have a conversation with him. Upon meeting him I got to know more about his project.

He is working on using Knowledge Graphs such that we can find connection between different artworks. It seems like an interesting project as I haven't seen Knowledge Graphs being used extensively for Computer Vision.

## Meeting #3
The next meeting was the one we were all waiting for. RedHen's Mass orientation meeting which was conducted on Zoom.

We got to meet a lot of people and there were also people who were doing their GSoC again with RedHenLab so that was interesting. We got to know some things about CWRU HPC and apart from that some good insights about other projects.

# Next week
The coding period officially begins.
