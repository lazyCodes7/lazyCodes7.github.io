## About me
Kansamida/Annyeonghaseyo! to whoever decided to visit me. I am Rishab Mudliar and currently I am working as a software developer at Oracle. I also spend my free time helping out potential contributors at RedHenLab to build a pipeline for understanding Christian Art.

## What do I really like/Passion?
Well after exploring a lot of stuff during my Major. Computer Vision is what I liked the most so I try to build projects in those domains. I do hackathons like a lot and I have won at a few of them. 

## What am I doing right now
- Well for starters I am watching this CS224N course by Chris Manning and it has made me realize how much I don't know and the prospect of getting to know more excites me.
- As a project, I am planning on building a GPT version of Emile Male's book 'The Gothic Image of Art' that works like ChatGPT. The book itself is very comprehensive and explains in details how to read Christian Art so I believe it will be useful for people not well-versed with this genre of art

## Research work
Did a really cool comparison study on the adversarial robustness of ViTs and CNNs against attacks like FGSM, BFA, One-Pixel Attack, Adversarial Patch attack. Also crafted a stealthy attack which will be slightly better than FGSM. Currently in the process of writing the paper for it.

## Favorite food
- Everything except my mess food.
- Although since I shifted to Hyderabad, I really love the biryani here.

## Hobbies
- Right now I am hooked on to some K-Dramas, Anime.
- Apart from that reading a lot of books
- Trying to learn the piano because I want to play songs from the anime shows that I watch.
