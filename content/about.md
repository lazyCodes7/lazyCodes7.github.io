## About me
Kansamida/Annyeonghaseyo! to whoever decided to visit me. I am Rishab Mudliar and currently I am in junior year of my Computer Science Undergrad. I spend most of my time building projects that solve real-life problems or doing hackathons:p

## What do I do
Well after exploring a lot of stuff during the 3yrs of my Computer Science Degree. Computer Vision is what I liked the most so I try to build projects in those domains. I do hackathons like a lot and I have won at a few of them. 

## Current explores!
Right now I am researching on the adversarial robustness of ViTs which are pretty cool compared to the SOTA CNNs but kind of not explored much w.r.t their robustness to adversarial attacks.

## Current project.
Right now I am working on a project related to interpretability of neural networks because I got really tired of people calling it a black box so I decided to unmask it!

## Favorite food

- Everything except my mess food.

## Hobbies
- Right now I am hooked on to some K-Dramas, Anime.
- Apart from that reading a lot of books
