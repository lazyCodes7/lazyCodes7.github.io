## Some individual projects.

-   ### BlacBox  

    #### About
    Consider a scenario where a military commander wants to identify enemy tanks and he uses an object-detection algorithm. So based on some data he reports an accuracy of 99%. Naturally he would be happy(enemies definetely wouldn't). But when he puts this algorithm to use he fails terribly. Turns out the data used had images of tanks only at night but not during day so instead of learning about the tank the algorithm learned to distinguish day from night. He would have lost but thanks to blacbox he uses our techniques to save his day!

-   ### SmartScrapes

    #### About
    While building products we often require feedback to improve but to take in 100 reviews at a single time is pretty tough to remember. Artificial Intelligence has transformed a lot of industries in the past and hence it makes sense to transform this arena as well. With SmartScrapes, these reviews are processed quickly using the power of Natural Language Processing which gives us a quick, efficient bird's eye view of the performance of the product involved.
