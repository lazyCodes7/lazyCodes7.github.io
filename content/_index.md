## Hi! 👋
I am Rishab, studying Machine Learning at Tubingen.

Previously,
- I worked as a Software Engineer at 💼[Oracle](https://oracle.com).
- Worked as a GSoC contributor and mentor at [RedHenLab](https://redhenlab.org)
- Worked as a ML Intern at [Polymerize](https://polymerize.io)
- Participated in lot of [hackathons](https://devpost.com/rishabmudliar?ref_content=user-portfolio&ref_feature=portfolio&ref_medium=global-nav) and won some by using Machine Learning:p

Nowadays, I spend my time at the university trying to make sense of 📈Mathematics in Machine Learning while trying to learn how self-driving cars 🚗 work...

And on the off days I try to learn how to speak Deutsch, play the keyboard sometimes and watch some anime.

If you'd like to connect with me, just send a [📫](mailto:rishabmudliar@gmail.com)
