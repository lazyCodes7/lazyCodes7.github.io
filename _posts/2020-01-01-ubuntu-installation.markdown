## My First blog

Hi there! I am Rishab Mudliar and coincidentally i am writing my first blog post on the first day of this year (I know this is a bad joke). I don't know how bad this will be but i hope it's not that bad that nobody understands..

### Why Ubuntu?
####1. Ubuntu is user-friendly
Many computer users consider Linux-based systems hard to use and made for developers. It’s a huge misconception and Ubuntu Linux acts as a perfect myth-buster. Just like Windows, installing Ubuntu Linux is very easy and any person with basic knowledge of computers can setup his/her system. Over the years, Canonical has improved the overall desktop experience and polished the user interface. Surprisingly, many people even call Ubuntu easier to use as compared to Windows

<h2>2. It is Free!</h2>

<p> Without a doubt it’s is a big reason to use Ubuntu Linux. Downloading, installing, and using Ubuntu Linux doesn’t cost a penny. Simply&nbsp;download it from Canonical’s website or visit your favorite torrent website, create a bootable ISO or burn it on a USB drive. It’s also being adopted at various educational and government organizations across the world to reduce costs. Moreover, most of the software is also free. </p>
