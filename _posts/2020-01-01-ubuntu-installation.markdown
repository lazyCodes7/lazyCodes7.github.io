<h2>Why Ubuntu?</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->
<h3>1. Ubuntu is user-friendly</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Many computer users consider Linux-based systems hard to use and made for developers. It’s a huge misconception and Ubuntu Linux acts as a perfect myth-buster. Just like Windows, installing Ubuntu Linux is very easy and any person with basic knowledge of computers can setup his/her system. Over the years, Canonical has improved the overall desktop experience and polished the user interface. Surprisingly, many people even call Ubuntu easier to use as compared to Windows</p>

<!-- wp:heading -->
<h3>2. It is Free!</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> Without a doubt it’s is a big reason to use Ubuntu Linux. Downloading, installing, and using Ubuntu Linux doesn’t cost a penny. Simply&nbsp;download it from Canonical’s website or visit your favorite torrent website, create a bootable ISO or burn it on a USB drive. It’s also being adopted at various educational and government organizations across the world to reduce costs. Moreover, most of the software is also free. </p>

<h3>3.No AntiVirus.</h3>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p> It’ll be wrong to say that Ubuntu is 100% immune to viruses. However, in comparison to Windows,&nbsp;which needs use&nbsp;of antivirus, the malware risks associated with Ubuntu Linux are negligible. It also saves you the antivirus cost because you don’t need any. Its built-in Firewall and virus protection method makes sure that you’re protected. Hooray!</p>

<h2>Flashing an ISO file</h2>
<!-- /wp:heading -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The ISO file we got from Installing Ubuntu should be used here</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":5783} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://vitux.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/word-image-127.png" alt="Burn iso file" class="wp-image-5783"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Here your Target should be your PenDrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Make sure that you copy your data from PenDrive into your storage so that you don’t lose your data while flashing the pendrive.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Before moving on to the next step we will create some space for Ubuntu by doing Partition so for this we will go to file explorer and then click on “This PC” and then right click and then click on Manage and then under Storage section we will click on Disk Management.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now we will select Windows(C)(you can chose whatever you want) after which we will</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:image {"id":38} -->
<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://ub8home.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/computer-management-1_1_2020-4_35_40-pm.png?w=1024" alt="" class="wp-image-38"/></figure>
<!-- /wp:image -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you can right click on Windows(C)(or whatever you want) and select “Shrink Volume” after this you have to wait for some time and then you accordingly enter how much space you want to partition and also create one more partition for transferring data into this partition as a backup.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>After doing this successfully, restart your computer and continuously press f9 or esc button or the button which shows boot options.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now there will be two options one is Windows Boot Manager and other one is Ubuntu(it should contain the word Ubuntu!).Click on the other one</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Now you shall see various options if you want to divide the space partitioned earlier you can click on “Try Ubuntu without Installing” and watch this video for further steps from 4:00 till the end.<br></p>
