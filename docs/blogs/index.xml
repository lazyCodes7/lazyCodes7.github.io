      <description>About Link to heading These blogs are my notes that represent my interpretation of the CS236 course taught by Stefano.&#xA;Recap Link to heading Learning a generative model. Link to heading We are given a training set of examples, e.g., images of dogs&#xA;We want to learn a probability distribution p(x) over images x such that&#xA;Generation: If we sample xnew ∼ p(x), xnew should look like a dog (sampling) Density estimation: p(x) should be high if x looks like a dog, and low otherwise (anomaly detection) Unsupervised representation learning: We should be able to learn what these images have in common, e.</description>

      <description>About Link to heading These blogs are my notes that represent my interpretation of the CS236 course taught by Stefano.&#xA;Recap: Learning a generative model Link to heading Recall that we want to learn a probability distribution p(x) over images x such that sampling from this distribution gives us new images. In the last part we dived deeper into probability distributions. Finally we saw ways to learn a probability distrubution for a discriminative model using techniques like logistic regression or neural models.</description>

      <description>About Link to heading These blogs are my notes that represent my interpretation of the CS236 course taught by Stefano.&#xA;Part 2 Link to heading Learning a generative model Link to heading In the last part we defined a statistical generative model represented as p(x) that lets us sample from this distribution to generate new images. But p(x) is unknown.&#xA;How do we learn it?&#xA;Before I go into it, we would be going into a lot of probablity terminologies that we will see.</description>

      <description>About Link to heading These blogs are my notes that represent my interpretation of the CS236 course taught by Stefano.&#xA;Part 1 Link to heading Generative Modelling Link to heading Generative modelling is a way to model/sample data that looks like something we might know.&#xA;I am going to put more weight on the last part as it is important to generate something that makes sense. For instance, a machine learning model that generates &amp;lsquo;qweefejfww&amp;rsquo; (random jargon) will not be of any use to us.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to talk about my experience about the &amp;ldquo;Bertelsmann Scholarship&amp;rdquo; via this post. I hope after reading this, more people will be interested in what I believe is a truly amazing program for learning something that might interest you!&#xA;Beginnings Link to heading It all started when one of my friends recommending this to program back in November. The application had 3 choices &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;. I decided to go with AI as I always wanted to try it out but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much knowledge about it.</description>

      <description>Protocols. Link to heading So what exactly are protocols? Protocols according to me are certain set of rules that we use to communicate with each other&#xA;Why do we use Protocols ? Link to heading So in brief I explained about protocols but the next question is why do we need them.Let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example,say I am Thor and I wanna talk to some new avenger(Night Monkey) then first I need Night Monkey&amp;rsquo;s permission to talk(although I can just smash him with thunder and make him talk) and then Night Monkey will talk to Thor and so on a talk session starts.</description>

      <description>My First Blog! Link to heading Hi there! I am Rishab Mudliar and coincidentally i am writing my first blog post on the first day of this year (I know this is a bad joke). I don&amp;rsquo;t know how bad this will be but i hope it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad that nobody understands..&#xA;Why Ubuntu? Link to heading 1. Ubuntu is user-friendly Link to heading Many computer users consider Linux-based systems hard to use and made for developers.</description>
