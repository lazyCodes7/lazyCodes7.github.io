      <description>Today I wanted to talk about my experience about the &amp;ldquo;Bertelsmann Scholarship&amp;rdquo; via this post. I hope after reading this, more people will be interested in what I believe is a truly amazing program for learning something that might interest you!&#xA;Beginnings Link to heading It all started when one of my friends recommending this to program back in November. The application had 3 choices &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;. I decided to go with AI as I always wanted to try it out but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much knowledge about it.</description>
