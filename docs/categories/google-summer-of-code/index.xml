      <description>This weekI continued my search for licensed souces and also found a really good site that provides API access/open access to museum metadata After compiling enough sources for 2 weeks I finally started the process for curation. Source 1 - The Web Gallery of ArtThe Web Gallery of Art provides access to 60,000 artworks in the form of a dataset. This source has also been used in other art-related datasets like SemArt and ArtDL.</description>

In order to get some idea on how to proceed with the sources collected I contacted my mentor Fred.
