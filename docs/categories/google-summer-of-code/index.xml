      <description>Why am I writing this blog? Link to heading Well I did my Google Summer of Code in 2022 that was like two years back. But every year I get a lot of people on LinkedIn or Twitter DMing about guidance, tips or just wanting to know about my experience. So this is a blog for them and to answer their questions!&#xA;So let&amp;rsquo;s get started..&#xA;Why RedHenLab? Link to heading Here in my college people are passionate to do GSoC like I am not kidding.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading Implemented the transformer model for captioning task Presented the demo of the pipeline to the mentors Changing the dataset(torch.Dataset instance i.e) Link to heading Earlier the dataset instance of PyTorch that I was using was simple. Whenever I referred an index it would return the image and numericalized version of the caption. But I wanted to use GPT2 for what it is good for. Hint: Text generation.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading Used a transformer based model to work on the captioning task A Transformer that uses images + text Link to heading During the last week&amp;rsquo;s meeting I had concluded that using models like Word2Vec might not always work as they have a fixed representation of each word but words can differ contextually so this week I decided to use some better language models like GPT2 and BERT.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading Worked on using the captions I had collected during the curation stage I also build up a CNN+LSTM model to see if we could achieve good captioning results without use of Transformers Approach towards using the text. Link to heading A image captioning model makes use of both text and an image but interpreting text can be difficult. Normally to solve this we use word embeddings which give us an idea about the similarity between two or more words.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading Read a chapter exclusively on saints from The Gothic Image by Emile Male. Annotated 200 images + previous images with more attributes I learned from reading the book by Emile Male Paintings in context Link to heading This whole time I had been curating images and trying to annotate them but after reading 70 pages of this book. It made things really clear for me so I think it will be great to explain how Christian Paintings really work.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading Worked on moving my module to CaseHPC Tried perfecting F-RCNN for detecting saints and their attributes in paintings. Regarding CaseHPC Link to heading One of the things I couldn&amp;rsquo;t do in the first phase of this program was to use Case Western&amp;rsquo;s HPC to train my models in general. So this week I decided to get my hands dirty and made my module work on one of the gpu nodes of Case HPC</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading This week I completed the module that extracts various attributes from the paintings. Apart from that I will be showcasing in this blog whatever I have done in phase-1&#xA;The Modified Pipeline Link to heading 1. Data Curation. Link to heading 2. Image Captioning Model Link to heading Changes Link to heading I have made very minute changes to the pipeline. One of my goals was to create a module for adding more data points but I have kept that on hold.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading This week I spent my time working on the module that would extract features from paintings&#xA;Meeting 1 Link to heading Since I was done with my curation I wanted some idea on how to proceed forward with my project and so I had mailed my mentors regarding the next steps for this project. This meeting was mostly oriented with what I had done and what are the results I could produce for the first evaluation.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading This week I spent curating data from two sources.&#xA;1. Corpus Vitrearum. Link to heading Corpus Vitrearum is a museum that has around 7000 stained glass artworks that are stored according to their iconclasses. By using various scraping techniques I scraped 2000 images that pertain to Christian iconographic content.&#xA;During the curation process I am also logging some of the attributes from the metadata. The advantage of this is that it keeps the dataset open to more usecases.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading This week I worked on curating data points from two sources i.e the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.&#xA;1. Art Institute of Chicago. Link to heading The Art Institute of Chicago provides open access to around 50,000 artworks with rich metadata involved. By using the search tool provided by the Institute we have got around 1500 results that pertain to containing Christian content in them.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading I continued my search for licensed souces and also found a really good site that provides API access/open access to museum metadata After compiling enough sources for 2 weeks I finally started the process for curation. Source 1 - The Web Gallery of Art Link to heading The Web Gallery of Art provides access to 60,000 artworks in the form of a dataset. This source has also been used in other art-related datasets like SemArt and ArtDL.</description>

      <description>This week Link to heading The project kickoff&#xA;Before the coding period began I had previously been working on classification of the Christian icons in the painting. But in order to caption art, we needed a good source. So I had been collecting sources here.&#xA;In order to get some idea on how to proceed with the sources collected I contacted my mentor Fred.&#xA;Minutes of the meeting.
