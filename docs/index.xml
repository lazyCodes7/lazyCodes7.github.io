      <description>This week    CWRU Accounts    The first thing that happened this week was that we got our CWRU Gmail accounts.
HPC Setup    After this it was time to setup CWRU&amp;rsquo;s HPC(High Performing Cluster). The steps for that are following.
  First setup CWRU&amp;rsquo;s VPN by following the guide here. Make sure that Duo is setup as a 2FA option as each time a connection to the VPN occurs a subsequent push notification is sent to Duo Mobile.</description>

      <description>Today I wanted to talk about my experience about the &amp;ldquo;Bertelsmann Scholarship&amp;rdquo; via this post. I hope after reading this, more people will be interested in what I believe is a truly amazing program for learning something that might interest you!
Beginnings    It all started when one of my friends recommending this to program back in November. The application had 3 choices &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;. I decided to go with AI as I always wanted to try it out but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much knowledge about it.</description>

      <title>Networking Protocols</title>

      <description>Protocols.    So what exactly are protocols? Protocols according to me are certain set of rules that we use to communicate with each other
Why do we use Protocols ?    So in brief I explained about protocols but the next question is why do we need them.Let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example,say I am Thor and I wanna talk to some new avenger(Night Monkey) then first I need Night Monkey&amp;rsquo;s permission to talk(although I can just smash him with thunder and make him talk) and then Night Monkey will talk to Thor and so on a talk session starts.</description>

      <description>My First Blog!    Hi there! I am Rishab Mudliar and coincidentally i am writing my first blog post on the first day of this year (I know this is a bad joke). I don&amp;rsquo;t know how bad this will be but i hope it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad that nobody understands..
Why Ubuntu?    1. Ubuntu is user-friendly    Many computer users consider Linux-based systems hard to use and made for developers.</description>
