      <description>This week This week I completed the module that extracts various attributes from the paintings. Apart from that I will be showcasing in this blog whatever I have done in phase-1
The Modified Pipeline 1. Data Curation. 2. Image Captioning Model Changes I have made very minute changes to the pipeline. One of my goals was to create a module for adding more data points but I have kept that on hold.</description>

      <description>This week This week I spent my time working on the module that would extract features from paintings
Meeting 1 Since I was done with my curation I wanted some idea on how to proceed forward with my project and so I had mailed my mentors regarding the next steps for this project. This meeting was mostly oriented with what I had done and what are the results I could produce for the first evaluation.</description>

      <description>This week This week I spent curating data from two sources.
1. Corpus Vitrearum. Corpus Vitrearum is a museum that has around 7000 stained glass artworks that are stored according to their iconclasses. By using various scraping techniques I scraped 2000 images that pertain to Christian iconographic content.
During the curation process I am also logging some of the attributes from the metadata. The advantage of this is that it keeps the dataset open to more usecases.</description>

      <description>This week This week I worked on curating data points from two sources i.e the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
1. Art Institute of Chicago. The Art Institute of Chicago provides open access to around 50,000 artworks with rich metadata involved. By using the search tool provided by the Institute we have got around 1500 results that pertain to containing Christian content in them.</description>

      <description>This week I continued my search for licensed souces and also found a really good site that provides API access/open access to museum metadata After compiling enough sources for 2 weeks I finally started the process for curation. Source 1 - The Web Gallery of Art The Web Gallery of Art provides access to 60,000 artworks in the form of a dataset. This source has also been used in other art-related datasets like SemArt and ArtDL.</description>

      <description>This week The project kickoff
Before the coding period began I had previously been working on classification of the Christian icons in the painting. But in order to caption art, we needed a good source. So I had been collecting sources here.
In order to get some idea on how to proceed with the sources collected I contacted my mentor Fred.

      <description>This week This week was mostly aimed towards meeting people from RedHenLab as well as our peers.
Meeting #1 Professor Mark organized a meeting consisting of mentors and contributors. The contributors were limited to the people Mark is mentoring. It was a normal discussion where people talked about the things they are doing where they are from etc.
Meeting #2 During the first meeting, Mark had informed me that Parth&amp;rsquo;s project and mine arise from a similar arena i.</description>

      <description>This week CWRU Accounts The first thing that happened this week was that we got our CWRU Gmail accounts.
HPC Setup After this it was time to setup CWRU&amp;rsquo;s HPC(High Performing Cluster). The steps for that are following.
First setup CWRU&amp;rsquo;s VPN by following the guide here. Make sure that Duo is setup as a 2FA option as each time a connection to the VPN occurs a subsequent push notification is sent to Duo Mobile.</description>
