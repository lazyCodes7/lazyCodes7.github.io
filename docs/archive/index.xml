      <description>Today I wanted to talk about my experience about the &amp;ldquo;Bertelsmann Scholarship&amp;rdquo; via this post. I hope after reading this, more people will be interested in what I believe is a truly amazing program for learning something that might interest you!
Beginnings It all started when one of my friends recommending this to program back in November. The application had 3 choices &amp;ldquo;AI&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Data&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Cloud&amp;rdquo;. I decided to go with AI as I always wanted to try it out but didn&amp;rsquo;t have much knowledge about it.</description>

      <description>Protocols. So what exactly are protocols? Protocols according to me are certain set of rules that we use to communicate with each other
Why do we use Protocols ? So in brief I explained about protocols but the next question is why do we need them.Let&amp;rsquo;s consider an example,say I am Thor and I wanna talk to some new avenger(Night Monkey) then first I need Night Monkey&amp;rsquo;s permission to talk(although I can just smash him with thunder and make him talk) and then Night Monkey will talk to Thor and so on a talk session starts.</description>

      <description>My First Blog! Hi there! I am Rishab Mudliar and coincidentally i am writing my first blog post on the first day of this year (I know this is a bad joke). I don&amp;rsquo;t know how bad this will be but i hope it&amp;rsquo;s not that bad that nobody understands..
Why Ubuntu? 1. Ubuntu is user-friendly Many computer users consider Linux-based systems hard to use and made for developers. It’s a huge misconception and Ubuntu Linux acts as a perfect myth-buster.</description>
